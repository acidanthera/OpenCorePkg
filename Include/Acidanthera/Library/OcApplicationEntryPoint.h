  Entry point to UEFI Application.

  This function is the entry point for a UEFI Application. This function must call
  ProcessLibraryConstructorList(), ProcessModuleEntryPointList(), and ProcessLibraryDestructorList().
  The return value from ProcessModuleEntryPointList() is returned.
  If _gUefiDriverRevision is not zero and SystemTable->Hdr.Revision is less than _gUefiDriverRevison,
  then return EFI_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION.

  @param  ImageHandle  The image handle of the UEFI Application.
  @param  SystemTable  A pointer to the EFI System Table.

  @retval  EFI_SUCCESS               The UEFI Application exited normally.
  @retval  EFI_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION  _gUefiDriverRevision is greater than SystemTable->Hdr.Revision.

  directly and library instances that a module depends on indirectly through other libraries.
