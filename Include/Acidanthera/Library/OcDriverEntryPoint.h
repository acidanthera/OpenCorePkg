/**
  The entry point of PE/COFF Image for a DXE Driver, DXE Runtime Driver, DXE SMM Driver, or UEFI Driver.

  This function is the entry point for a DXE Driver, DXE Runtime Driver, DXE SMM Driver,
  or UEFI Driver.  This function must call ProcessLibraryConstructorList() and
  ProcessModuleEntryPointList(). If the return status from ProcessModuleEntryPointList()
  is an error status, then ProcessLibraryDestructorList() must be called. The return value
  from ProcessModuleEntryPointList() is returned. If _gDriverUnloadImageCount is greater
  than zero, then an unload handler must be registered for this image and the unload handler
  must invoke ProcessModuleUnloadList().
  If _gUefiDriverRevision is not zero and SystemTable->Hdr.Revision is less than _gUefiDriverRevison,
  then return EFI_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION.


  @param  ImageHandle  The image handle of the DXE Driver, DXE Runtime Driver, DXE SMM Driver, or UEFI Driver.
  @param  SystemTable  A pointer to the EFI System Table.

                                     or UEFI Driver exited normally.
  @retval  EFI_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION  _gUefiDriverRevision is greater than SystemTable->Hdr.Revision.
